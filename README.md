## General info
It is one of the Data Analysing projects which is suppoused to hone my skills in that category.

Main goals of the project were:
* Visualisation and charts creation wuth Matplotlib.
* Pivot, group and manipulate data with Pandas.
* Work with timestamp and timeseries.
* Style and customize a line chart.

As a notebook I used Datalore from Jetbrains.

Data used in this project were generated from Stack Overflow.

It's one of the projects from [Angela's Python Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/)
